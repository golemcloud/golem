# Action Plan and Checklist for Golem GUI Development

## Project Objectives

1. Build a **TypeScript-based GUI application** for managing Golem components, workers, APIs, and plugins.
2. Integrate the application into the **single executable build** of Golem.
3. Provide a **developer-friendly experience** with polished UI/UX design.
4. Ensure functionality supports all Golem backend APIs.

## Plan

### Phase 1: **Core Decisions**

- [x] Set up a Tauri + React project for single executable build
- [x] Choose a UI framework TailwindCSS, shadcn for consistent and modern design. (since console.golem.cloud use same
  setup it is easy for developer to use it)
- [x] Integrate cross-platform support Tauri for bundling as an executable.
- [x] Set up backend API connections using Golem REST API.
- [x] Create a development environment with live reloading.

### Phase 2: **Core Features Implementation**

#### Component Management

- [X] Create new components.
- [x] List existing components.
- [x] Update component versions.
- [x] Delete components.
- [x] Export components.
- [x] Link workers to components.
- [x] Display component status.
- [x] Manage file permissions and download components.
- [ ] Support to add file as part of componet creation

#### Worker Management

- [x] Provide an overview of worker information.
- [x] Create new workers from components.
- [x] Delete running workers.
- [x] Pause/suspend workers.
- [x] Invoke worker functionality.
- [x] Display logs of worker invocations.

#### API Management

- [x] Create new APIs.
- [x] Manage API versions.
- [ ] Create and manage routes for invoking APIs.
- [x] Delete API versions.
- [x] Delete all routes.

#### Plugin Management

- [x] Create plugins.
- [x] List available plugins.
- [x] Update/version plugins.
- [x] Delete plugins.

### Phase 3: **Integration into Single Executable**

- [x] Integrate the GUI application with the Golem CLI using Rust.
- [x] Bundle the GUI application into the single executable build.
- [x] Test cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).

### Phase 4: **UI/UX Enhancements**

- [x] Design a consistent and modern interface.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for cross-platform usability.
- [ ] Add loading spinners, progress bars, and error notifications.

### Phase 5: **Testing and Validation**

- [ ] Conduct unit testing for each module.
- [ ] Perform integration testing for GUI and backend APIs.
- [ ] Validate the application on different operating systems.
- [ ] Gather developer feedback and iterate.
