# Golem Contributor License Agreement

**Version 1.1 — Effective February 24, 2026**

This agreement ("Agreement") covers contributions you submit to Golem. "We" means Golem Cloud, Inc. "You" means the person or entity submitting a contribution.

You accept this Agreement by posting the required acceptance comment on a pull request, as prompted by our CLA tool. You only need to sign once per version of this Agreement.

A **contribution** means any work you submit for potential inclusion in Golem, including code, documentation, tests, and other materials, and modifications or additions to existing works. A contribution does not include communications you conspicuously mark at the time of submission as **NOT A CONTRIBUTION**.

## What you keep

You keep ownership of everything you contribute. This Agreement grants us a license — it does not assign your intellectual property to us. You are not expected to provide support for your contributions unless you choose to.

We are not obligated to include any contribution in Golem.

## What you grant

You grant us a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable** license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and otherwise exploit your contribution and derivative works, in any context.

You also grant us a corresponding **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable** patent license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, under any patent claims you own or control that are necessarily infringed by your contribution, alone or combined with Golem, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer your contribution and Golem.

These licenses take effect when you submit the contribution, whether or not we include it.

If you or any entity that controls you, is controlled by you, or is under common control with you initiate or voluntarily participate in patent litigation alleging that Golem or a contribution to it infringes a patent, this patent license terminates for the litigating party and any entity that controls it, is controlled by it, or is under common control with it. This does not limit your right to bring claims for breach of this Agreement.

We may distribute your contribution under **any license**, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses. If we include your contribution in Golem, we will also keep it available to the public in source code form under the license that applied to Golem when you submitted it. We may satisfy this by making it available through a public repository, a public release archive, or an equivalent public source distribution.

To the extent permitted by law, you waive moral rights in your contribution against us and our licensees. Where waiver isn't permitted, you agree not to assert them in ways that would prevent us from exercising the rights above.

## What you confirm

You confirm that:

(a) You have the right to grant these licenses — whether you own the code, have your employer's permission, or your employer has signed this Agreement on behalf of your organization.

(b) If your contribution includes third-party code, you have identified it and its license at the time of submission.

(c) Your contribution does not contain trade secrets or confidential information you aren't authorized to share.

(d) To the best of your knowledge, your contribution does not infringe anyone's intellectual property.

If you later become aware that any of these statements was inaccurate, you will promptly notify us.

If you accept this Agreement on behalf of a company or other organization, you represent that you have authority to bind it, and the grants and confirmations above apply to contributions owned or controlled by that organization.

## Disclaimer and liability

YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED **AS IS**. NEITHER PARTY MAKES WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

NEITHER PARTY IS LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.

## General

**No trademarks.** This Agreement does not grant rights to anyone's trademarks.

**Entire agreement.** This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us regarding contributions covered by it.

**Governing law.** Maryland law governs, excluding conflict-of-law rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Disputes go to Maryland state or federal courts.

**Assignment.** We may assign this Agreement to a successor, provided they accept its obligations. You may not assign without our written consent.

**Amendments.** We may publish updated versions. Updates apply only after you accept the new version. Your existing contributions remain under the version you accepted at the time of submission.

**Severability.** Unenforceable provisions are limited to the minimum extent necessary; the rest survives. Nothing here overrides mandatory protections in your home jurisdiction.

## Plain-Language Summary

*This summary is for convenience only. The Agreement governs.*

You're granting Golem Cloud, Inc. a broad license to use your contributions, including in commercial products and under different licenses. You keep full ownership of your code. If Golem includes your contribution, Golem commits to keeping it available in source form under the license that applied when you submitted it.

Your contribution is provided as is with no warranties on either side. If the CLA changes, you will be asked to accept the new version before your new contributions are covered by it.
