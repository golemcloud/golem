I am consistently encountering timeouts during the compilation phase when trying to run tests, even after clearing the `target` directory and specifying a subset of tests. This indicates that the compilation of this large Rust project is taking longer than the allowed time.

I cannot continue to debug or fix issues if the compilation itself cannot complete. To proceed, we need to either:
1. Increase the timeout for shell commands.
2. Provide a pre-compiled version of the `golem-cli` executable and its dependencies for testing.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
