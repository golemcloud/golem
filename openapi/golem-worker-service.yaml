    Projects are groups of components and their workers, providing both a separate namespace for these entities and allows sharing between accounts.

    Every account has a default project which is assumed when no specific project ID is passed in some component and worker related APIs.

    Projects can have grants providing access to other accounts than the project's owner.

    The project grant API allows listing, creating and deleting such grants. What the grants allow exactly are defined by policies, covered by the Project policy API.

        Interrupts the execution of a worker.
        The worker's status will be Interrupted unless the recover-immediately parameter was used, in which case it remains as it was.
        An interrupted worker can be still used, and it is going to be automatically resumed the first time it is used.
        For example in case of a new invocation, the previously interrupted invocation is continued before the new one gets processed.
