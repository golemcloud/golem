    Projects are groups of components and their workers, providing both a separate namespace for these entities and allows sharing between accounts.

    Every account has a default project which is assumed when no specific project ID is passed in some component and worker related APIs.

    Projects can have grants providing access to other accounts than the project's owner.

    The project grant API allows listing, creating and deleting such grants. What the grants allow exactly are defined by policies, covered by the Project policy API.
