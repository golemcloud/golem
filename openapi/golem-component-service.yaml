    Projects are groups of components and their workers, providing both a separate namespace for these entities and allows sharing between accounts.

    Every account has a default project which is assumed when no specific project ID is passed in some component and worker related APIs.
- name: ProjectGrant
  description: |-
    Projects can have grants providing access to other accounts than the project's owner.

    The project grant API allows listing, creating and deleting such grants. What the grants allow exactly are defined by policies, covered by the Project policy API.
- name: ProjectPolicy
  description: Project policies describe a set of actions one account can perform when it was associated with a grant for a project.

      summary: Get the metadata for all component versions
      description: |-
        Each component can have multiple versions. Every time a new WASM is uploaded for a given component id, that creates a new version.
        This endpoint returns a list of all versions for the component id provided as part of the URL. Each element of the response describes a single version of a component, but does not contain the binary (WASM) itself:

        - `versionedComponentId` associates a specific version with the component id
        - `componentName` is the human-readable name of the component
        - `componentSize` is the WASM binary's size in bytes
        - `metadata` contains information extracted from the WASM itself
        - `metadata.exports` is a list of exported functions, including their parameter's and return value's types
        - `metadata.producers` is a list of producer information added by tooling, each consisting of a list of fields associating one or more values to a given key. This contains information about what compilers and other WASM related tools were used to construct the Golem component.
