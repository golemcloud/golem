      title: EnvironmentWithDetails
      description: |-
        A cross-tenant, enriched view of an environment used specifically by the
        `GET /environments` endpoint.

        This type exists because a user may be able to see an environment (as the
        owner or through an active share) **without having access to its parent
        application or owning account**. In those cases, returning only the
        `Environment` model would not provide enough context for UI navigation or
        for users to understand *whose* environment they are interacting with.

        `EnvironmentWithDetails` therefore bundles:
        - a summarized `Environment` (fields intrinsic to the environment),
        - minimal identifying information about the parent `Application`,
        - minimal identifying information about the owning `Account`.

        This structure is *only* used for environment discovery/listing.
        All other environment endpoints (`GET /environments/:id`, updates, deletes)
        continue to return the standard `Environment` model, since those requests
        operate within the application/account they belong to.

        In short:
        **EnvironmentWithDetails = EnvironmentSummary + minimal parent context**,
        enabling safe, cross-tenant environment visibility without exposing
        full application/account resources.
