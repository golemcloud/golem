	///
	/// It is worth noting that the exact terminology for bucket in key-value stores
	/// can very depending on the specific implementation. For example,
	/// 1. Amazon DynamoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a table
	/// 2. Redis has hashes, sets, and sorted sets as different types of collections
	/// 3. Cassandra calls a collection of key-value pairs a column family
	/// 4. MongoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a collection
	/// 5. Riak calls a collection of key-value pairs a bucket
	/// 6. Memcached calls a collection of key-value pairs a slab
	/// 7. Azure Cosmos DB calls a collection of key-value pairs a container
	///
	/// In this interface, we use the term `bucket` to refer to a collection of key-value
