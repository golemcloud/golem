Business Source License 1.1

Parameters
----------

Licensor:
  Golem Cloud, Inc.

Licensed Work:
  Golem (the durable computing runtime/server software made available in this
  repository, including any modified versions and derivative works of that
  software)

The Licensed Work is (c) 2023-2026 Golem Cloud, Inc.

Additional Use Grant
--------------------

You may make use of the Licensed Work, including in production, provided that
you may not use the Licensed Work for a Golem Developer Platform Service.

1) Prohibited Use — Golem Developer Platform Service

A "Golem Developer Platform Service" is a commercial hosted or managed
service that:

  (a) is offered to third parties outside your organization (other than your
      employees and contractors acting on your behalf); and

  (b) makes the Licensed Work (or the material functionality of the Licensed
      Work) available as a platform or runtime so that those third parties can
      develop, deploy, host, or run their own applications, agents, workflows,
      or services on infrastructure that you operate or manage (including
      infrastructure operated or managed by a third party on your behalf); and

  (c) is reasonably understood by a reasonable person familiar with the software
      industry (based on the service's functionality, documentation, onboarding,
      pricing, packaging, or positioning) to be an application platform /
      runtime / infrastructure service (for example, a PaaS, serverless
      offering, durable execution platform, workflow runtime, agent runtime,
      or similar), rather than a domain-specific application.

A service may be a Golem Developer Platform Service regardless of whether
it exposes the Licensed Work's native APIs. Using a proxy, wrapper, proprietary
API, SDK, CLI, GUI, DSL, or any other interface does not avoid this limitation
if the service otherwise meets the definition above.

2) Explicit safe harbors (non-exhaustive)

For the avoidance of doubt, the following scenarios are explicitly permitted
under this license and do NOT constitute a Golem Developer Platform Service:

  • Applications and SaaS products built on Golem.
    Any product or service in which the Licensed Work is used as an internal
    implementation component — whether the product targets developers, business
    users, or any other audience, and including agentic applications — is
    permitted, even if users can configure, customize, or extend the product
    (including by defining agents or workflows, supplying rules, writing scripts,
    uploading plugins, or generating code), provided that the product or service
    does not offer the Licensed Work (or the material functionality of the
    Licensed Work) as a hosted or managed application platform, runtime, or
    infrastructure service for third parties to develop, deploy, host, or run
    their own applications, agents, workflows, or services.

  • Internal use.
    Any internal deployment (including an internal managed platform) where only
    the licensee (or its organization, employees, and contractors) uses the
    Licensed Work.

  • On-prem / downloadable distribution.
    Delivering the Licensed Work (modified or unmodified) to a specific customer
    for that customer's own use in its own environments (including self-hosted
    production use) is permitted, subject to that customer's compliance with
    this License.

  • Professional services.
    Providing consulting, integration, training, support, or other professional
    services related to the Licensed Work is permitted, provided that you do not
    provide the Licensed Work as a hosted or managed service to third parties
    (for example, you do not operate the Licensed Work on behalf of a customer
    as a managed service).

  • Frameworks, libraries, and tools.
    Building and distributing frameworks, libraries, tools, and other software
    that incorporate or are built using the Licensed Work is permitted, including
    under open-source licenses. Any use of the Licensed Work as incorporated in
    such software remains subject to this License and this Additional Use Grant.
    Distributors must comply with the notice requirements of this License set
    forth in the Terms below.

3) Explicitly not permitted (illustrative)

For the avoidance of doubt, the following scenarios are NOT permitted under this
license:

  • A commercial hosted or managed service that offers Golem-powered durable
    execution, workflow, or agent runtime capabilities as a platform for third-
    party developers or engineering teams (including through dedicated or
    single-tenant deployments) to deploy, host, and run their own applications
    or services — whether or not the service is branded as "Golem," and whether
    or not it exposes the Licensed Work's native APIs.

  • A commercial hosted or managed service that embeds or wraps the Licensed
    Work (under any interface) and offers it to third parties as a competing
    application platform, runtime, or infrastructure service.

Change Date:
  4 years after release

Change License:
